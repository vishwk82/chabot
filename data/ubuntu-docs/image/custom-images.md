# Custom images

Building a bespoke image for a [Supported platform](../platforms.md) enables an
Ubuntu Core device to be customised at the point of deployment.  Customisation
options include configuration for both hardware and software, specific kernels,
and which snap packages to pre-install.

See [Image building](image-building.md) for an overview of building reference
Ubuntu Core images for a supported platform.

Building for non-reference architectures is also easily accomplished but
requires upstream enablement. For further details, <a

## Prerequisites

To build a custom image, first use the _snapcraft_ command to login to the [Snap
Store](https://snapcraft.io/store):

```bash
$ snapcraft login
```

Snapcraft can be installed with `sudo snap install snapcraft --classic`, see
[Snapcraft overview](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapcraft-overview) for further
details, and visit [Create a developer
account](https://snapcraft.io/docs/creating-your-developer-account) if you
don't yet have an account.

Before creating a custom model assertion, you will need to retrieve your
developer ID and generate a properly formatted timestamp. The _snapcraft_
command can be used to retrieve your developer id:

```bash
$ snapcraft whoami
email: <email>
developer-id: bJzr2XzZ56Qv6Z51HIeziXvxtn1XItIq
```

Use the following _date_ command to output the correctly formatted timestamp
for the model assertion:

```bash
$ date -Iseconds --utc
2020-03-10T12:34:57+00:00
```

## Custom model assertion

The following is a tweaked JSON-structured custom model assertion based on
[ubuntu-core-18-amd64](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-core/18/stable/current/ubuntu-core-18-amd64.model-assertion):

```json
{
  "type": "model",
  "series": "16",
  "model": "ubuntu-core-18-amd64",
  "display-name":"Ubuntu Core 18 (amd64)",
  "architecture": "amd64",
  "kernel": "pc-kernel=18",
  "gadget": "pc=18",
  "base": "core18",
  "required-snaps": ["hello", "hello-world"],
  "authority-id": "bJzr2XzZ56Qv6Z51HIeziXvxtn1XItIq",
  "brand-id": "bJzr2XzZ56Qv6Z51HIeziXvxtn1XItIq",
  "timestamp": "2020-03-10T12:05:38+00:00"
}
```

We've saved the above example in a file called `my-model.json`, and it contains
the following modified properties:

- `base`: provides the run-time environment  
  _core18_ is the current standard base and as is built from [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/). See [Base snaps](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/base-snaps/11198) for more details.
- `authority-id`, `brand-id`: defines the authority signing the assertion  
  reference assertions are signed by `canonical`. Non-reference assertions are
signed by their [brand store](build-store/index.md). For a custom model
assertion, this needs to be the developer ID.
- `timestamp`: UTC formatted time and date  
  used to denote the assertion's creation time.
- `required-snaps`: one or more snaps to be pre-installed for deployment
  any snap can be listed here. If there's a dependency on a different base, such as _core_, this will be installed too.  

For a complete list of model assertion keywords, see [Model assertion](../reference/assertions/model.md).

## Signing a model assertion

The difference between building an image from a reference model assertion and
building from a modified model assertion is that the modified model assertion
needs to be digitally signed. This is accomplished in four stages:

1. create a key
1. export/register the key
1. sign the model assertion
1. build the image

<div class="p-notification--positive"><p markdown="1" class="p-notification__response"><span class="p-notification__status">Note:</span>
Rather than creating a key for every device, the same key is typically used across all models or model family.
</p></div>

First, sign in to the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/store) (_snap login_)
and check whether there is already a published key available. You can list any
published snaps with the _snap keys_ command:

```bash
$ snap login
[...]
Login successful

$ snap keys
No keys registered, see `snapcraft create-key`
```

If you have no registered keys, create one as follows:

```bash
$ snap create-key my-models
Passphrase:
Confirm passphrase: <passphrase>

$ snap keys
Name         SHA3-384
my-key-name  E-n0AOKPFjIyy4S_i9JxTT4tkuaZf7rP9D2ARCmBNXjlgTGDjL8euFSlb87U0NPl
```

With a key created, use the _snapcraft_ command to upload and register it with
the store:

```bash
$ snapcraft register-key
Registering key ...
```

A custom model assertion is signed by piping the assertion through the _snap
sign_ command with the key name as its sole argument:

```bash
$ cat my-model.json | snap sign -k my-key-name > my-model.model
```

The resulting `my-model.model` file contains the signed model assertion and can
now be used to build the image.

## Building the image

With a [signed model assertion](#signing-a-model-assertion), the Ubuntu Core
image can now be built just like a reference image, using the
[ubuntu-image](image-building.md#building-with-ubuntu-image) command:

```bash
$ ubuntu-image snap my-model.model
Fetching snapd
Fetching pc-kernel
Fetching core18
Fetching pc
Fetching hello
Fetching hello-world
Fetching core
WARNING: model has base "core18" but some snaps ("hello", "hello-world") require "core" as base as well, for compatibility it was added implicitly, adding "core" explicitly is recommended
```

As with when building a reference image, you can now use the image to boot either
real or virtual hardware. See [Building the
image](image-building.md#building-with-ubuntu-image) for more details.


From within a running session on a custom image, you can run the pre-installed
snaps:

```bash
$ hello-world
Hello World!
```

Use _snap list_ to see which snaps are installed:


```bash
$ snap list
Name         Version       Rev   Tracking  Publisher   Notes
core         16-2.43.3     8689  stable    canonical✓  core
core18       20200124      1668  stable    canonical✓  base
hello        2.10          38    stable    canonical✓  -
hello-world  6.4           29    stable    canonical✓  -
pc           18-2          36    18        canonical✓  gadget
pc-kernel    4.15.0-88.88  399   18        canonical✓  kernel
snapd        2.43.3        6434  stable    canonical✓  snapd
```

The _snap known model_ command will show the read-only custom model
assertion used to build the image:

```bash
$ snap known model
type: model
authority-id: bJzr2XzZ56Qv6Z51HIeziXvxtn1XItIq

brand-id: bJzr2XzZ56Qv6Z51HIeziXvxtn1XItIq

architecture: amd64
base: core18
display-name: Ubuntu Core 18 (amd64)
gadget: pc=18
kernel: pc-kernel=18
required-snaps:
  - hello
  - hello-world

```
