# Snaps in Ubuntu Core

Ubuntu Core is built from _snaps_, a secure, confined, dependency-free,
cross-platform Linux packaging format.

Snaps are entirely self-contained, even to the point of encapsulating their own
file system, and this means they include everything needed to run. They're used
by Ubuntu Core to both compose the image that's run on a device, and to deliver
consistent and reliable software updates, often to low-powered, inaccessible,
and remotely administered embedded and IoT systems.

Whether it's an update to a single device, a specific subset of devices, or a
deployment of tens of thousands of devices, snaps enable Ubuntu Core to
maintain and verify a system’s integrity:

- **Autonomous updates to any device** - the update service needs to be a
  reliable and automatic process, catering for a predictable update cadence and
an optional fine level of control over when and how updates are delivered

- **Incomplete and problematic update recovery** - the inaccessible nature of
  many embedded device installations makes it imperative that updates are
impregnable and capable of withstanding broken, blocked, partial and
interrupted updates

- **Critical update provision** - in specific circumstances when an ad-hoc or
  critical update needs to be made, the update system needs to give these
priority and incorporate the update back into the regular update service

- **Unpredictable hardware and network conditions** - in situations that can’t
  be easily modelled or predicted, any update system needs to have enough
redundancy to handle roll-backs, network-free bootstrapping and autonomous
re-provisioning

## Types of snap

The snap packaging ecosystem consists of the following parts:  

- **snap** is both the command line interface and the application package format
- **snapd** is the background service that manages and maintains your snaps
- **snapcraft** is the command and the framework used to build your own snaps
- **Snap Store** provides a place to upload your snaps, and for users to browse and install

Developers can publish snaps to the Snap Store or to their own private _Brand
Store_. They take sole responsibility for update cadence and quality. While
snaps are commonly known as an application packaging format, Ubuntu Core is
built from several different types of snap:

1. **kernel**: defines the Linux kernel for a device  
    The kernel snap is selected with a _model assertion_ which is produced and
signed before the image is built. Once the image is built, the kernel snap may
be updated but cannot be replaced by a completely different kernel snap.

1. **gadget**: defines system properties  
     The gadget snap is responsible for defining and manipulating the system
properties which are specific to one or more devices that will usually look
similar to one another from an implementation perspective. 

1. **core**: provides the execution environment  
     The core snap is the execution environment inside which application snaps
run. It also serves as the root file system for Ubuntu Core images. The current
core snap is built from Ubuntu 18.04 packages.

1. **app**: applications, daemons and tools  
     Packages applications, pulled from multiple upstream sources using diverse
build systems. The _snapd_ daemon is itself installed as a snap (except with an
old _core_, where it's included). 

As with the core file system, snaps are presented to the system as read-only and
are granted access to whatever resources they need through a set of explicit
permissions, known as interfaces. Interfaces are implemented using well-tested
Linux kernel confinement features.
