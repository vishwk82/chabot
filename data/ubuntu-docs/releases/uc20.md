# Ubuntu Core 20

<span class="p-notification__status">UC20 is currently under active development.</span></br>
</p></div>

Ubuntu Core 20 (UC20) is built on the foundations of [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal
Fossa)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/). It's the next generation of Ubuntu
for embedded devices.

New features for this release include:

- Full-disk encryption via TPM integration </br>
  currently x86 only with ARM to follow. beta1 TPM integration works with existing CA </br>
- Recovery mode menu and chooser
- A new recovery and reinstall mode
- Initial [MAAS](https://maas.io/) & cloud-init support
- Raspberry Pi support (both ARMv7 and ARM v8)

### Latest image downloads

## Recovery mode chooser

To access the recovery chooser, reset or start up UC20 while holding the `1`
key.

![UC20 Recovery chooser](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/fe1a74d5-uc20_chooser_01.png)


The `1` key needs to be held until the initial boot process completes, after
which you'll be presented first with the system selection menu followed by the
following recovery options:

- **Run normally**: Continue with the boot process.
- **Recover**: reboot into recovery mode and log into the system using prior
  credentials to recover your data, either via SSH or locally after setting up
a password for the user.
- **Reinstall**: initialise the device from the listed system version image.
  All existing user data on the device will be removed.

## Model definition

The model definition has been expanded for UC20 devices to include several new
options, most notably grade and snaps (see [Custom
images](../image/custom-images) for details on building images).

### `grade:`

Sets the constraints for the device. It can be one of the following:

- **`dangerous`**: relax some of the constraints here (mandatory snap id for
  example), and should allow for the use of unasserted snaps, devmode snaps, or
the presence of extra snaps in the recovery system.
- **`signed`** _(default)_: no unasserted (unsigned) snaps or snaps not mentioned
  in the model can appear or be used in the recovery system.
- **`secured`**:  same properties as signed plus it is mandatory for the device to
  use full disk encryption and secure boot.

### `snaps:`

A new header to control which snaps comprise the device setup. It consists of
the following keywords and mappings:

- `name` _(mandatory)_: name of the snap. Cross-checked at image build time but ignored later
- `type` _(mandatory)_: type of the snap, needs to be either: `base|gadget|kernel|app|core`.
  _app_ is the default
- `id` _(optional)_: id of the snap if assigned by a store. Must be omitted for local snaps.
- `modes` _(optional)_: a list with UC20 modes (verbs, "run") or mode aliases ("ephemeral",
  covers all recovery/tmpfs modes) for which the snap needs to be installed.
Default is _[run]_, should not be used for types `kernel|gadget` and for the
snap indicated by the "base" header
- `presence` _(optional)_:  set to mark a snap whose absence will not fail
  installation or recovery. Can be optional or required of which required  is
the default
- `default-channel` _(optional)_: initial tracking channel for the snap,
  default is "latest/stable"

The appearance of the snaps keyword prohibits the use of gadget, kernel and
required-snaps  as the same information and more is conveyed through the snaps
header.

## Example UC20 Model definition

The following is an example model definition for amd64:

```yaml
type: model
authority-id: canonical
series: 16
brand-id: canonical
model: ubuntu-core-20-amd64-beta
architecture: amd64
base: core20
grade: signed
snaps:
  -
    default-channel: 20/beta
    id: UqFziVZDHLSyO3TqSWgNBoAdHbLI4dAH
    name: pc
    type: gadget
  -
    default-channel: 20/beta
    id: pYVQrBcKmBa0mZ4CCN7ExT6jH8rY1hza
    name: pc-kernel
    type: kernel

## Testing UC20

The easiest way to test the latest UC20 release is to download the latest image
and either write the image to a USB storage device, and test the build on real
hardware, or use the image with a virtual machine.

If your hardware supports TPM, and has [UEFI Secure
Boot](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UEFI/SecureBoot) enabled, UC20 will use these to
deploy a fully encrypted system. When redeploying to the same device, the TPM
will need to be cleared.

To test UC20 with QEMU ([https://www.qemu.org/](https://www.qemu.org)), first install the
[OVMF](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UEFI/OVMF) package (eg. `sudo apt install ovmf`)
then run the following command to boot a UC20 image (renamed pc.img) within a
virtual machine:

```bash
sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -smp 2 -m 2048 \
 -net nic,model=virtio -net user,hostfwd=tcp::8022-:22 \
 -drive file=/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd,if=pflash,format=raw,unit=0,readonly=on \
 -drive file=pc.img,cache=none,format=raw,id=disk1,if=none \
 -device virtio-blk-pci,drive=disk1,bootindex=1 -machine accel=kvm
```

<div class="p-notification--warning"><p markdown="1" class="p-notification__response">
<span class="p-notification__status">Older OVMF packages can cause QEMU boot problems. Either <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/How-to-run-OVMF">build them manually</a>, or consider extracting the files from a more recent package. <a href="https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/powerpc/ovmf">OVMF</a> for <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/">Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)</a> is known to work.
</p></div>

With a successful boot, Ubuntu Core initialisation will ask for both networking
parameters and an Ubuntu One account (see <https://snapcraft.io/account>). 

When the initialisation process has finished, and rebooted, you can SSH to the
device using either the physical device network address,  or localhost port
8022 for the above QEMU example command:

```bash
$ ssh <username>@localhost -p 8022
```
