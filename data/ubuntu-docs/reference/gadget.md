# Gadget snap

The gadget snap is responsible for defining and manipulating system properties
specific to one or more devices. 

It contains device-specific support code and data, and is produced and signed
by the device [brand](https://snapcraft.io/docs/glossary#heading--brand-store)
via a [model assertion](assertions/model.md).

The gadget snap may encode the mechanisms for device initialisation, key
generation and identity certification, as well as particular processes for the
lifecycle of the device, such as factory resets.

 It is perfectly possible for different models to share a gadget snap.

## Setup files

In addition to traditional snap metadata, the gadget snap also holds some setup files fundamental to the initialization and lifecycle of the device:

- `meta/snap.yaml` - Traditional snap details, with `type: gadget` explicitly defined.
- `meta/gadget.yaml` - Gadget-specific information. See below.
- `grub.conf` - Required grub configuration when using this bootloader.
- `u-boot.conf` - Required u-boot configuration when using this bootloader.
- `cloud.conf` - Optional [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) configuration; cloud-init is disabled if missing.

Sample configuration files may be found in the reference gadget snaps:

- [Raspberry Pi (2B, 3B, 3A+, 3B+, 4B, Compute Module 3, and Compute Module 3+)](https://github.com/snapcore/pi-gadget)
- [Beagleblack](https://github.com/ogra1/beaglebone-gadget)
- [Dragonboard](https://github.com/snapcore/dragonboard-gadget)
- [amd64](https://github.com/snapcore/pc-amd64-gadget)
- [i386](https://github.com/snapcore/pc-i386-gadget)

## The gadget.yaml file

Four YAML keys are used to describe your target device:

* `defaults` (YAML sub-section, optional): default configuration options for
  the defined snaps, applied on installation.

```yaml
defaults:
    <snap id>:
        <key>: <value>
```

* `device-tree` (filename, optional): the Device Tree Blob path. If device-tree
  is specified, `dtbs/filename` must exist in kernel or gadget snap (depends on
origin) and `snap_device_tree_origin` and `snap_device_tree` are made available
for u-boot and grub.
* `device-tree-origin` (string, optional): `kernel` or `gadget` (default)
  depending if the DTB is located in the kernel or in the gadget snap.
* `volumes` (YAML sub-section, required): the volumes layout, where each disk
  image is represented as a YAML sub-section.

### The `volumes` sub-section

Each volume is described by:

* a name (required)
* a partition structure (required)
* a bootloader definition (`grub`, `u-boot`)
* a partitioning schema eg. `mbr`

Volumes define the structure and content of the images to be written into one
or more block devices of the gadget device. Each volume in the structure
represents a different image for a "disk" in the device.

### Specification

The `meta/gadget.yaml` file contains the basic metadata for gadget-specific
functionality, including a detailed specification of which structure items
compose an image. The latter is used both by snapd and by ubuntu-image when
creating images for these devices.

A gadget snap's boot assets can also be automatically updated when the snap is
refreshed. See [Updating gadget boot
assets](https://snapcraft.io/docs/gadget-boot-assets) for further details.

The following specification defines what is supported in `gadget.yaml`:

```yaml
# Define the format of this file. The default and latest format is zero.
# Clients reading this file must reject it the format is greater than
# the supported one. (optional)

# Default configuration options for defined snaps, applied on installation.
# The snap ID may be discovered via the snap info command.
# Since 2.33 snap ID can be the "system" nick to cover the system
# configuration. (optional)
defaults:
    <snap id>:
        <key>: <value>

# Interface connection instructions for plugs and slots of seeded

## prepare-device hook

The optional `prepare-device` hook will be called on the gadget at the start of
the device initialisation process, after the gadget snap has been installed.
The hook will also be called if this process is retried later from scratch in
case of initialisation failures.

The device initialisation process is, for example, responsible for setting the
serial identification of the device through an exchange with a device service.
The `prepare-device` hook can for example redirect this exchange and
dynamically set options relevant to it. 

One must ensure that `registration.proposed-serial`  is set to a value
**unique**  across all devices of the brand and model and that it does not
contain a `/`. It is going to be used as the "serial number" (a string, not
necessarily a number) part of the identification in case the device service
supports setting it or **requires** it, as is the case with the *serial-vault*.

<summary>**Example: prepare-device hook**</summary>

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# optionally set the url of the service
snapctl set device-service.url="https://device-service"
# set optional extra HTTP headers for requests to the service
snapctl set device-service.headers='{"token": "TOKEN"}'

# set an optional proposed serial identifier, depending on the service
# this can end up being ignored;
# this might need to be obtained dynamically
snapctl set registration.proposed-serial="DEVICE-SERIAL"

# optionally pass details of the device as the body of registration request,
# the body is text, typically YAML;
# this might need to be obtained dynamically
snapctl set registration.body='mac: "00:00:00:00:ff:00"'
