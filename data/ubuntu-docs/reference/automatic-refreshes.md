# Automatic refreshes

Installed snaps are automatically refreshed a few times a day, assuming a different revision is available on the channel being tracked.

More details about when it is to be triggered may be obtained via:

```bash
$ snap refresh --time
timer: 00:00~24:00/4
last: today at 09:08 BST
next: today at 15:09 BST
```

Check the state of recent updates with:

```bash
$ snap changes
ID   Status  Spawn               Ready               Summary
870  Done    today at 09:08 BST  today at 09:10 BST  Auto-refresh snap "core"
```

and to view the details for a specific update, pass its ID to the *change* command:

```bash
$ snap change 870
