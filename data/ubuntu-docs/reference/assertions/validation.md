# validation assertion

The validation assertion tells us that a certain revision for a snap that is gated
by another snap has been validated for a given series. It is closely related to the
[snap-declaration](snap-declaration.md) assertion.

The format is as follows:

```text
type:                   validation
authority-id:           <authority account-id>
revision:               <int>
series:                 <list of series which should accept this assertion>
snap-id:                <snap-id>
approved-snap-id:       <snap-id>
approved-snap-revision: <int>
timestamp:              <UTC datetime>
revoked:                <bool>
sign-key-sha3-384: <key id> # Encoded key id of signing key

<signature>                 # Encoded signature
```

The index is the tuple <`series`, `snap-id`, `approved-snap-id`, `approved-snap-revision`>.
This assertion means that refreshing to revision number `revision` of snap
`approved-snap-id` for `series` has been aproved by `authority-id`, being `snap-id`
the snap that was gating the update, of which `authority-id` must be the owner.
`approved-snap-id` must be part of the `refresh-control` list in the snap-declaration
assertion of `snap-id` for this to be enforced.

In other words, the recomended revision for `approved-snap-id` in a system that
has `snap-id` installed is the one in the `revision` header. There will be no
automatic installation of newer revisions until a validation with a newer revision
is released by the store. Note however that this does not forbid a forced update
by the device owner.

The validation can be revoked by using the optional flag `revoked`.

An example of this type:

```text
type: validation
authority-id: canonical
revision: 1
series: 16
snap-id: kkOOPWIl0sF7FoSA0KRTt83b1eoynkBa
approved-snap-id: JIpOmfrI0JpaN3uNQQgNv5x3fW06nOYX
approved-snap-revision: 37
timestamp: 2017-02-20T10:23:51+00:00
