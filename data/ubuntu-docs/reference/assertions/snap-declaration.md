# snap-declaration assertion

The snap-declaration assertion defines some of the properties of the snap, such
as the snap-id, the official name, the publisher, and so on. This assertion is
downloaded along the snap when installing a snap from a store and has information
on actions to take when performing the installation.

The format is as follows:

```text
type:               snap-declaration
authority-id:       <authority account id>
revision:           <int>
series:             <series this assertion was created for>
snap-id:            <string>
snap-name:          <string>
publisher-id:       <the owner of this snap-id space>
timestamp:          <UTC datetime>
refresh-control:    <list of snap-ids that have gated updates>
  - [snap-id1]
  - [snap-id2]
  - ...
auto-aliases:       <optional list of aliases that are automatically enabled>
  - [alias1]
  - ...
plugs:              <map from [interface] to plug side rules>
  [interface]:      <optional plug side rules for [interface]>
    allow-installation:     <true|false>
    deny-installation:      <true|false>
    allow-connection:       <true|false>
    deny-connection:        <true|false>
    allow-auto-connection:  <true|false>
    deny-auto-connection:   <true|false>
  ...
slots:              <map from [interface] to slot side rules>
  [interface]:      <optional slot side rules for [interface]>
  ...               <similar options as rule entries for plugs>
sign-key-sha3-384: <key id> # Encoded key id of signing key

<signature>                 # Encoded signature
```

The index is the tuple <`series`, `snap-id`>. `snap-id` is a key with the same
format as the account ids.

This assertion gives control on several aspects of the snap behaviour to the
the authority:

* `refresh-control` gives a list of snaps that are gated when the one
specified by `snap-id` is installed,
so they are not automatically refreshed until they are "validated".
Validation is performed by using [validation asserts](validation.md), which specify the
revision of the gated snap that should be installed if the gating snap
has been installed.

* `auto-aliases` gives a list of the aliases that we want to
automatically enable when installing the snap. Aliases provide short
names for applications contained in the snap, so we do not need to use
the full command name <snap-name>.<command>. They are defined inside snap.yaml,
but they are not activated by default unless included in the `auto-aliases`
list. Having this inside a signed assertion lets snapd create the aliases
only if curated by a trusted authority.

* `plugs` and `slots` define flags per interface. This lets define restrictions
on how the snap plugs/slots used by the snap are handled. For instance, we can
allow or deny connections with `allow-connection` and `deny-connection`.
With `allow-auto-connection` or `deny-auto-connection` we let snapd know
if it should automatically connect plugs/slots on snap installation.

snap-declaration assertions for installed snaps can be seen by issuing
`snap known snap-declaration`.

As an example, for the modem-manager snap from the Ubuntu store we have:

```text
type: snap-declaration
format: 1
authority-id: canonical
revision: 9
series: 16
snap-id: KtwxgRlwCAVKFw92BUdt1WloH1Va3QPo
plugs:
  modem-manager:
    allow-auto-connection: true
publisher-id: canonical
slots:
  modem-manager:
    allow-connection: true
snap-name: modem-manager
