# Ubuntu Core documentation

Welcome to the home of Ubuntu Core documentation.

> Ubuntu Core is Ubuntu, engineered for IoT and embedded systems. It's easy to
deploy, tamper-resistant and hardened against corruption.

Ubuntu Core features:

- **simple, consistent installation and deployment**: Ubuntu Core is installed
  via an immutable image, which can be either installed or built specifically
  for your platform and application
- **a read-only filesystem**: apps run in isolation from each other and access
  to system resources is only granted with explicit permissions
- **transactional updates**: signed, autonomous and atomic, updates can withstand
  unpredictable hardware and network conditions, even to the operating system
- **snap-based, security first**: snaps are secure, easy to build, and painless
  to distribute. Public/private key validation ensures what's running is
exactly what's intended to run

From a single Raspberry Pi, to a deployment of tens of thousands, it's the
ideal platform for anything that needs to run securely, be ever-ready,
autonomously updated, and tamper-proof.

To learn more, take a look at the highlighted documentation below, or dive into
