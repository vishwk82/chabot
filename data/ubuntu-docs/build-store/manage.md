# Manage

Brand stores have two administrative roles: admins and reviewers.

* Admins manage general settings of the store, such as security policies enforced on packages and snaps it includes from other stores.<br>[What are the available settings?](settings.md)
* Reviewers control the flow of packages to users, comment on, approve or reject uploaded snaps, grant per-snap overrides for warnings and errors detected by the automated review process and set up per-snap features, such as automated aliases, auto-connecting interfaces, and refresh control.<br>[How to review a snap?](reviews.md)
