# Board enablement overview

This document will walk you through all the steps to enable an unsupported board and build an Ubuntu Core image for it.

You will learn how to:

* [Create a kernel snap](#the-kernel-snap)
* [Create a gadget snap](#the-gadget-snap)
* [Create a model assertion](#the-model-assertion)
* [Build an image](#image-building)

Note: this documentation has been tested and performed on Roseapple Pi, you can find the complete example source in [this repository](https://github.com/kubiko/roseapple-pi-ubuntuCore-build).

## The kernel snap

Ubuntu Core kernels are based on the `multiv7_defconfig` plus some mandatory Ubuntu configs (see the `snapcraft.yaml` example below).

You can find reference kernels here: [https://github.com/snapcore/sample-kernels](https://github.com/snapcore/sample-kernels)

Once you have a kernel ready for Ubuntu core, the recommended way to build a kernel is with [snapcraft](http://snapcraft.io). Preferably host the `snapcraft.yaml` for the kernel in your device build tree, independent of the kernel tree.

#### Kernel `snapcraft.yaml` example

## The gadget snap

The [gadget snap](../../guides/build-device/gadget.html) is a key snap for device boot, as it contains the description of the boot and file system layout, which is then used for image building.

You will need to create two files in the `meta` directory of this snap:

* `meta/snap.yaml` containing the basic device description, together with device specific interfaces if needed
* `meta/gadget.yaml` describing the device boot mode and its filesystem layout.

#### `meta/snap.yaml` example

    name: roseapple-pi
    version: 16.04-1
    summary: Roseapple Pi support package
    description: |
     Support files for booting Roseapple Pi
    type: gadget
    architectures:
        - armhf


#### `meta/gadget.yaml` example

    device-tree: actduino_bubble_gum_sdboot_linux.dtb
        volumes:
          roseapplepi:
            schema: mbr
            bootloader: u-boot
            structure:
              - offset: 2097152 #4096*512
                size: 2097152 #2M
                type: mbr
                content:
                    - image: boot-assets/bootloader.bin
                      offset: 512 #(4097-4096)*512
                    - image: boot-assets/u-boot.bin
                      offset: 1048576 #(6144-4096)*512
              - type: 0C
                filesystem: vfat
                filesystem-label: system-boot
                size: 128M
                content:
                  - source: boot-assets/
                    target: /

As of writing, snapcraft does not support native gadget building, you can snap it by running:

    snapcraft snap <directory with gadget snap content>

## The model assertion

Before you can build an image to flash on the board, you need to prepare a [model assertion](../../reference/assertions.html) and sign it.

First, prepare a JSON file describing the model assertion:

#### Example model assertion for a Roseapple Pi

    {
      "type": "model",
      "authority-id": "<your store account id>",
      "brand-id": "<your store account id>",
      "series": "16",
      "model": "roseapple",
      "architecture": "armhf",
      "gadget": "roseapple-pi",
      "kernel": "roseapple-pi-kernel",
      "timestamp": "<timestamp>"
    }

##### Keys description

*   `type`: the assertion type you are creating
*   `authority-id`, `brand-id` refer to your store account id. You will find it on [your account page](https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/dev/account/), in the `Account-Id` field.
*   `series`: the Ubuntu Core series in use
*   `model`: a free form lower-case name for your target device
*   `architecture`: the architecture of the device you are building the image for
*   The `gadget` and `kernel` values refer to the name of your kernel and gadget snaps
*   `timestamp` is a valid timestamp you need to generate using the `date -Iseconds --utc` command

Additional supported keywords for model assertion are:

- `required-snaps`: list of strings describing the list of additional snaps to be preinstalled
- `core`: define a custom core snap that needs to be used

### Sign the model assertion

Before signing the model, you need to have a valid key registered with your store account. Make sure the `snapcraft` and `snap` commands know about you by logging in using the email address attached to your account.

    snapcraft login
    snap login you@yourdomain.com

Note that `logout` commands are available as well.

To check for keys on your machine, run

    snap keys

For backup purposes, snap keys are stored under `~/.snap/gnupg`

#### Key creation

If you do not have a key, create a new one. You can pass an optional name for the key. If you don't, the key name will be `default`.

    snap create-key my-key

Then, register the key with your store account:

    snapcraft register-key my-key

#### Signature step

Now you have to sign the model assertion with your key, by piping your JSON model through the `snap sign -k <key name>` command and outputting a model file you will use to build your image.

    cat roseapple-model.json | snap sign -k my-key &> roseapple.model

You can find a more detailed example of this process on the [custom image building](../../guides/build-device/image-building.html) page.

#### Canonical signed assertions

Alternatively, if you just want to build an image using a kernel and gadget snaps signed by Canonical, you can use Canonical signed model assertions. Assertions for Canonical supported boards can be fetched from the Ubuntu store, for example:

    curl -H "Accept: application/x.ubuntu.assertion" "https://assertions.ubuntu.com/v1/assertions/model/16/canonical/pc-amd64"

Or

    curl -H "Accept: application/x.ubuntu.assertion" "https://assertions.ubuntu.com/v1/assertions/model/16/canonical/pi3"

If you are running on system with snapd, you can also use the following command:

    snap known --remote model series=16 brand-id=canonical model=pc-amd64

Or

    snap known --remote model series=16 brand-id=canonical model=pi3

## Image building

Ubuntu Core images are built using the `ubuntu-image` command.

Ubuntu image is in beta. You can install it from the store with:

    snap install --beta --devmode ubuntu-image

This snap will not auto-update, so if want to get the latest version of `ubuntu-image`, run periodically:

    snap refresh --beta --devmode ubuntu-image

You can now build your image using the following command:

    sudo ubuntu-image \
    -c stable \        # available channels are: edge/beta/candidate/stable
    --image-size 4G \
    --extra-snaps <gadget snap file name, e.g. roseapple-pi_16.04-1_armhf.snap> \
    --extra-snaps <kernel snap file name, e.g. roseapple-pi-kernel_3.10.37-1_armhf.snap> \
    --extra-snaps <add more preinstalled snaps here, names from the store or local paths>
    -o <image output file name, e.g. roseapple-pi-20161107-0.img>
    <model file name, e.g. roseapple.model>

Note: The `--extra-snaps` argument takes either a snap name accessible from the store or a local path to a built snap.

Your image is ready, you can use a tool like `dd` to write the image to an SD Card and boot your board.

### Build a custom image for a reference board

To build a custom image for one of the Canonical supported boards, use a Canonical signed model assertion, as described above and use a gadget and kernel snaps from the store.

#### Example for a custom Raspberry Pi3 image

    curl -H "Accept: application/x.ubuntu.assertion" "https://assertions.ubuntu.com/v1/assertions/model/16/canonical/pi3" > pi3.model

    sudo ubuntu-image \
    -c stable \
    --image-size 4G \
    --extra-snaps pi2-kernel \
    --extra-snaps pi3 \
    --extra-snaps nextcloud \
    -o pi3-20161107-0.img \
    pi3.model
