# Getting started

Ubuntu Core is built from snaps, a secure, confined, dependency-free,
cross-platform Linux packaging solution.

It's ideal for IoT and embedded systems because it manages itself.
Whether it's running on a Raspberry Pi hidden for media streaming, or a
Qualcomm DragonBoard tucked away in a garage to handle automation, Ubuntu Core
handles application and security updates autonomously, 

Snaps are used by Ubuntu Core to both compose the image run on a device,
and to deliver consistent and reliable software application updates, often to
low-powered, inaccessible, and remotely administered embedded and IoT systems.

While Ubuntu Core can operate much like a traditional Ubuntu installation, its
installation, management and deployment is directed by its snap foundations, as
outlined below:

<h2 id='heading--requirements'>1. Requirements</h2>

Ubuntu Core runs on a large range of hardware, and pre-built images are
available for specific reference platforms. These images are a great way to
quickly get started with Ubuntu Core on a Raspberry Pi, for example, or to
explore Ubuntu Core's features and evaluate its potential. See [Supported
platforms](../../platforms.md) for more details.

Alongside enough storage to hold the Ubuntu Core image, installation also
requires a screen and keyboard to navigate a few installation prompts. These
aren't needed post-installation. 

Additionally, you will need an [Ubuntu SSO account](https://login.ubuntu.com/),
with associated [SSH keys](https://login.ubuntu.com/ssh-keys). This setup is
required because, after Ubuntu Core has been installed, Ubuntu SSO is used to
marshal local or remote logins to your device. This behaviour can be changed
after the first login. For help importing SSH keys, see the [Ubuntu community
wiki](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys).

When Ubuntu Core is up and running, if you want to access your device remotely,
you'll need an SSH client for your operating system. Linux and macOS both have
clients built-in, whereas Windows users could use [Ubuntu on
WSL](https://ubuntu.com/wsl).

<h2 id='heading--releases'>2. Choose a release</h2>

Ubuntu Core releases track a corresponding [Ubuntu LTS
release](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle), and there are currently three
supported versions available:

| **Ubuntu Core version** | **Ubuntu base** | **Status** |
|--|--|--|
| Ubuntu Core 20 (UC20) | [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/) | [beta1](../../releases/uc20.md) |
| Ubuntu Core 18 (UC18) | [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/) | supported |
| Ubuntu Core 16 (UC16) | [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/)  | supported |

Ubuntu Core is more than a repackaged version of Ubuntu. Ubuntu Core 20, for
example, offers full-disk encryption, a new recovery mode and Raspberry Pi
ARMv7 and ARMv8 support.

Ubuntu Core 18 has the broadest hardware and compatibility support, and we
currently recommend this for general use. Ubuntu Core 16 is useful for some
legacy systems.

<h2 id='heading--installing'>3. Install Ubuntu Core</h2>

The typical installation procedure is as follows:

1. **Download your preferred Ubuntu Core image for your device**</br>
   See [Supported platforms](../../platforms.md) for links to images.</br>
   By default, images are compressed with _xz_ and can be expanded with `xz -d <image-name.img.xz`.
1. **Write the image to your device's storage medium** (eg. SD card for Raspberry Pi)</br>
   We recommend using [Raspberry Pi imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) for Windows, macOS and Linux.
1. **Boot the device from the flashed storage and follow the on-screen prompts**</br>
   This step is version-specific, but the installation typically asks only two questions.

For example, when booting a fresh Ubuntu Core 18 image on a Raspberry Pi with a
keyboard and monitor connected, after pressing enter twice to navigate the
preamble, you're first asked to configure a network connection.  Standard DHCP
ethernet connections are configured automatically, but for integrated Wifi, you
need to navigate to the `wlan0` device and press _Enter_ to access SSID and
wifi settings. When complete, select _Done_ to complete the network
configuration. 

The final step for any Ubuntu Core installation is to enter the email address
associated with your SSO account. This is what provides the secure and
automatic authentication to your device, and subsequent reboots of your
hardware will show host fingerprints alongside the SSH command required to
access your device. Use this to connect to your device:

```bash
$ ssh <your key> <SSO identity>@<device IP address>
```
### Testing Ubuntu Core with QEmu

You can test Ubuntu Core without specific hardware from within a virtual
machine.

To test Ubuntu Core with QEMU ([https://www.qemu.org/](https://www.qemu.org)),
on Ubuntu, first install the `qemu-kvm` package and test it with _kvm-ok_:

```bash
$ sudo apt install qemu-kvm
$ kvm-ok
```
To ensure compatibility with the UEFI security features in Ubuntu Core 20, also
install the [OVMF](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UEFI/OVMF) package:

```bash
sudo apt install ovmf
```

The exact command to run will depend on your host hardware capabilities, such
as available memory and CPU cores, but the following should work in the
majority of cases:

```bash
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -smp 2 -m 1500 \
 -netdev user,id=mynet0,hostfwd=tcp::8022-:22,hostfwd=tcp::8090-:80 \
 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=mynet0  -drive file=pc.img,format=raw \
 -drive file=/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd,if=pflash,format=raw,unit=0,readonly=on
```

In the above command, the Ubuntu Core image is called _uc.img_ and we forward
the virtual SSH port 22 to port 8022 on the host, and 80 to 8090 for any web
server you run. To access this configuration from your host machine, type the
following:

```bash
$ ssh <your key> <SSO identity>@<device IP address> -p 8022
```

<h2 id='heading--using'>4. Using Ubuntu Core</h2>

In use, the Ubuntu Core environment is much like a vanilla Ubuntu environment. The
main difference is that its system configuration, package management, and
update control is all governed by _snapd_, the snap daemon.

Snap features are comprehensively explained in the [Snap
documentation](https://snapcraft.io/docs), but we'll cover some basic
operations below:

You can list which snaps are installed with _snap list_:

```bash
$ snap list
Name       Version        Rev   Tracking     Publisher   Notes
core20     20             768   latest/beta  canonical✓  base
pc         20-0.4         108   20/beta      canonical✓  gadget
pc-kernel  5.4.0-47.51.1  598   20/beta      canonical✓  kernel
snapd      2.46.1         9279  latest/beta  canonical✓  snapd
```

The above shows the standard set of snaps in a default Ubuntu Core 20
installation. For more details on what these do, see [Snaps in Ubuntu
Core](../../coresnaps.md).

As Ubuntu Core is a minimal installation, one of the first things you might
want to install is a text editor. You can search for snaps using _snap find_,
or the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/store). Nano is a good choice:

```bash
$ snap install nano
```

By default, Ubuntu Core defaults to disabling access to most resources,
including writing files to your home directory. Permissions in snap and Ubuntu
Core are handled by _interfaces_. You can see which interfaces nano needs with
the _snap connections_ command:

```bash
snap connections nano
Interface        Plug                  Slot  Notes
home             nano:home             -     -
removable-media  nano:removable-media  -     -
```

Connecting the [home](https://snapcraft.io/docs/home-interface) interface
between Ubuntu Core and _nano_ will allow you to save files to your home
directory. This is accomplished with the _connect_ command:

```bash
$ snap connect nano:home :home
$ snap connections nano
Interface        Plug                  Slot   Notes
home             nano:home             :home  manual
removable-media  nano:removable-media  -      -
```

After running the above command, you will now be able use nano to create and
edit text files in your home directory!

The `:home` syntax denotes the _home_ slot on Ubuntu Core. For more information
on how to work with interfaces, see [Interface
management](https://snapcraft.io/docs/interface-management) in the snap
documentation.

To remove a snap from your system, along with its internal user, system and
configuration data, use the remove command:

```bash
$ sudo snap remove nano
nano removed
```

For more information on how to work with snaps, including how to control
daemons/servers, how to make data snapshots and how to install specific
revisions, see the [Snap Documentation](https://snapcraft.io/docs/).
